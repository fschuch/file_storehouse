## Main Features

File-Storehouse is a lightweight Python package that aims to facilitate the management of files in bulk quantity.

There are four key points that are combined to achieving such a goal:

* Mapping Interface - The file managers are leveraged by the Mapping and MutableMapping interfaces, which means that everything can be done using a friendly dict-like interface. For instance:

  ```python
  # Store data to a file:
  file_manager[id] = file_content
  # Retrine data from a file
  file_content = file_manager[id]
  # Delete a file
  del file_manager[id]
  # Loop through all files
  for id, content in file_manager.items():
      pass
  # and many more...
  ```

* Engine - Choose the engine (or back-end) your file managers are connected to:

  * S3 buckets, powered by [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html);
  * Local filesystem and more are planned.

* Key Mapping - Customize a two-way key mapping between the dict-like keys and the files' location at the engines according to the business rules of your application.

* Transformations - Configure a chained operation to convert the files back and forward between your Python code and the storage. The supported operations are:

  * Encode/decode bytes and strings;
  * Dump/load Json files;
  * Compress/decompress tarballs and more transformations are planned.
